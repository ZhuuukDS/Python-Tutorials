# Python_notes
### This is my repo with collection of notes from different `python` courses from the very beginning of my learning process
I consider these notes as something between the course-notes and cheatsheets. <p>
I split the notes by the main topics for easier navigation. <p>
Mainly it was created to help myself to recall everything I learned, but I hope it can be aslo useful for all who just started learning `python`. <p>
